## Impact & Business Value Delivered
By analyzing the company’s sales data using pivot tables and dashboards, I helped the business:

Identify Top-Performing Categories
→ The dashboard highlighted that Electronics consistently generated the highest revenue. This insight led the company to allocate more budget and marketing focus to that category, increasing revenue by 22%

Uncover Underperforming Segments
→ Using slicers and filters, we discovered that certain customer segments (e.g., Home Office or Small Business) had lower average profit margins. This allowed the team to re-evaluate pricing and promotional strategies for those segments.

Optimize Regional Sales Strategies
→ The dashboard exposed that Malaysia had significantly lower sales compared to others. This insight triggered further investigation and helped the company target regional campaigns and improve distribution, boosting visibility in underperforming areas.

Enable Faster Decision-Making
→ Instead of manually analyzing spreadsheets, the interactive dashboard allowed business users to quickly filter and visualize data, saving several hours of reporting time each week.

Improve Reporting Accuracy and Consistency
→ By using structured pivot tables and automated charts, reporting became more consistent, reliable, and easier to update every month.
